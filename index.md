## About Me

Greetings!

I received my B.Sc. in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering, with a minor in Information and Computing Science, from [Zhejiang University of Technology](https://www.zjut.edu.cn/) in 2024.

During my undergraduate studies, I participated in an exchange program at the [Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley](https://physics.berkeley.edu/), USA.

Additionally, I spent a year as an exchange student at [The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo](https://www.uec.ac.jp/eng/), where I conducted research under the supervision of [Prof. Hiroki Saito](http://hs.pc.uec.ac.jp/saito/index-e.html) at the [UEC Saito Lab](http://hs.pc.uec.ac.jp/index.html).

## Research Interests

- **Bose-Einstein Condendation:** Quantum droplets, Supersolid
- **Atom Interferometer:** Atom Gravimeter
- **Brain Computer Interface:** Convolutional Neural Network, Electroencephalic Robotic Arm

## Misc
I’m a ski enthusiast, and Niseko in Hokkaido is my favorite ski resort. During my first visit, I accidentally ventured into the advanced area and nearly lost contact on the snowy mountain. Thankfully, two kind Japanese gentlemen came to my rescue. I’m forever grateful to them, and I’m determined to conquer Niseko again someday.
