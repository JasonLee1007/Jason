## About Me

Greetings!

I received my B.Sc. in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering, with a minor in Information and Computing Science, from [Zhejiang University of Technology](https://www.zjut.edu.cn/) in 2024.

During my undergraduate studies, I participated in an exchange program at the [Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley](https://physics.berkeley.edu/), USA.

Additionally, I spent a year as an exchange student at [The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo](https://www.uec.ac.jp/eng/), where I conducted research under the supervision of [Prof. Hiroki Saito](http://hs.pc.uec.ac.jp/saito/index-e.html) at the [UEC Saito Lab](http://hs.pc.uec.ac.jp/index.html).

## Research Interests

- **Bose-Einstein Condendation:** Quantum droplets, Supersolid
- **Atom Interferometer:** Atom Gravimeter
- **Brain Computer Interface:** Electroencephalic Robotic Arm

      <h3>Formation of Two-Dimensional Quantum Droplets</h3>
      <p><strong>Research Advisor:</strong> Professor Hiroki Saito</p>
      <p><strong>Duration:</strong> October 2022 - September 2023</p>
      <p>Explored the stability and formation of two-dimensional quantum droplets in ultracold gases, focusing on balancing dipole and contact interactions. The project involved solving the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation using the pseudospectral method to determine the ground state, crucial for understanding the droplets' density and stability.</p>

      <h3>Measurement of Gravitational Acceleration Based on Cold Atom Interference</h3>
      <p><strong>Research Advisor:</strong> Professor Qiang Lin</p>
      <p><strong>Duration:</strong> July 2022 - September 2022</p>
      <p>Investigated high-precision gravity measurements using cold atom interferometry. The study involved cooling rubidium-87 atoms to sub-microkelvin temperatures, splitting atomic wave packets into coherent paths, and analyzing the resulting interference patterns to accurately measure gravitational acceleration.</p>
